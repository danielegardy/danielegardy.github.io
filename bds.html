<h2>Analysis of database performances.</h2>
<p>My work in this area was mainly centered about evaluating the sizes
of "derived" relations in a relational database framework, in the
hope ofunderstanding the performance of query
optimisers. Interestingly, it turned out that these sizes follow a
Gaussian distribution under a wide spectrum of assumptions, thus
lending theoretical fundation to the empirical choices made by query optimisers, who limited
themselves most of the time to the average value.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>More recently, we also analyzed the occupancy rate of external
nodes in B-trees, through a Polya urn model. Surprizingly, we
were able to show that there is a phase transition and that "small"
and "large" sizes of nodes give different asymptotic behaviours.</p>
