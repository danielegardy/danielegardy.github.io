<h2>Random Allocations and Urn Models<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>My interest on random allocations dates from studies on database performances in the 80s.
Some results deal with identifying classes of models (often related to database modelization, or to a learning problem) that are amenable to a uniform treatment. They often lead to so-called "occupancy urn models", i.e. models where balls are thrown into a sequence of urns and the question is, e.g., the distribution of the number of empty urns. Some of these results are static, some are « semi-dynamic » in the sense that queries and insertions, but not deletions, are allowed, and some are fully dynamic and allow for deletions.&nbsp;</p>

Some years ago I went back to allocation models, driven by the need to
analyze some random generation algorithms, for which "waiting-time models" turned out to be well-suited:</p>

<ul style="position: relative; z-index: 0; ">
  <li>analyzing the performance of an algorithm for random
  generation of Hadamard product leads to a boys-and-girls birthday
  problem &nbsp;(with O. Bodini and O. Roussel, who both were then at Paris 6).
<br>
</li>
<li>a random generation algorithm for ARN sequences leads to a Coupon Collector model with unequal probabilities (with Y. Ponty at LIX).</li>
</ul>
