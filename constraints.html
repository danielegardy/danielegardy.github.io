<h2>Performance of constraint solvers.</h2>
<p>A question initially asked by  <a
href="http://www.normalesup.org/~truchet/">Charlotte Truchet</a></li>,
about the possibility of applying probabilistic analysis to constraint
solvers, lead us to propose a model for analyzing the effect of the
constraint <font face = "Verdana" size="2">ALLDIFFERENT</font>. Checking whether this constraint is satisfied
can be quite costly, and we worked out a model to predict the
probability that it would effectively reduce the sizes of the variable
domains. This approach can obviously be applied to other constraints.</p>

<h2>Logical analysis of data (LAD).</h2>
<p>
	This work has been done in collaboration with Frederic Lardeux and Frederic Saubion from the University of Angers.
	
LAD aims at computing a logical justification for dividing a group of data (data instance) in two groups of observations.
It is an interesting rule-based learning alternative to classic statistical learning techniques, with many practical applications. 
However the computation of the groups characterization may be costly, depending on the properties of the data instances. 
We provide effective tools for speeding up the computations, by first proposing several models for representing the data set of observations, 
according to the information we have on it, then computing a priori probabilities that a given set of attributes does 
characterize the two groups.
These probabilities also allow for quick assessing of some properties of the real data at hand, 
and may help to better analyze and understand the computational difficulties encountered by solving methods.  
 
Once the models have been established, the mathematical tools for computing probabilities come from Analytic Combinatorics.
A long-range goal of this paper is to show how the methods of Analytic Combinatorics can help in analyzing the performance of 
various algorithms in LAD and related fields.
